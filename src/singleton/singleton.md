# The singleton design pattern

Singleton design patterns are utilised when you wish to make one instance of a class, and have that class be accessible at all times.
An example of this is if you want to make a catalogue that stores all instances of a material.

- Create a PRIVATE constructor
- Write a static getInstance method that returns the singular instance of that object
